# Inertia Update

This mod updates the inertia, overweight limit, and stamina capacity values to match the EFT live patch 0.14.6.0 (12 May 2024).

These changes will be included in SPT 3.9.0, at which point this mod will be obsolete. Please delete it when that time comes.

All changes are enabled by default but you can edit the `/config/config.json` file to enable/disable each type of change as you wish.

As from the official changelog: 
* Reduced base inertia strength by 20%
* Increased overweight limit by 15%
* Increased base stamina capacity by 15%
